1. Define a method
2. Create a for loop to iterate through the array
3. Create a conditional statement that checks two values at a time
    3a. If the first value is less, the order remains the same. eg. 2 3 --> 2 3
    3b. If the first value is more, the order is switched. eg. 3 2 --> 2 3
4. Output the sorted list
